This operation is in violation of state regulations and poses significant risks to public safety and the economic well-being of legitimate businesses.\n\nMr. Pape's catering business is operating without the necessary state registration, thereby evading taxes and creating unfair competition for established, tax-paying restaurants in the area.  This illegal activity results in a direct loss of state tax revenue.\n\nFurthermore, the operation presents substantial hazards to the surrounding residential zone. The lack of regulation exposes the community to potential fire risks stemming from improper cooking equipment and setups, as well as significant food safety hazards due to the absence of a properly inspected and regulated kitchen facility.\n\nWe request an immediate investigation into Mr. Pape's activities to ensure compliance with all applicable state regulations.  This investigation should encompass the verification of business registration, tax compliance, and a thorough assessment of the safety hazards presented by this unregulated operation.\n\nSincerely,\n",

            "draft": "Dear Texas Government Official,\n\nThis email concerns the illegal operation of a catering business by an individual named John Pape (email: john.pape@gmasil.com).  This business is operating without the necessary state registration and permits, in violation of Texas law.\n\nThis unregistered operation poses several serious problems. Firstly, it creates unfair competition and negatively impacts legitimate, tax-paying restaurant businesses in the area, which are subject to stringent health and safety regulations and tax obligations.\n\nSecondly, the operation presents significant safety hazards. Conducted within a residential zone, the business likely involves improper cooking setups, posing a substantial fire risk.  Furthermore, the lack of regulation raises concerns regarding food safety and potential health risks to consumers.\n\nFinally, the state is experiencing a direct loss of tax revenue due to this unregistered and unregulated business activity.\n\nWe request a thorough investigation into the activities of Mr. Pape and his unregistered catering business.  We believe swift action is necessary to address these violations, protect the public, and ensure a level playing field for legitimate businesses in the state.\n\nSincerely,\n",
